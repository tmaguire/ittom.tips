title: About IT Tom Tips
---
This blog is to help me (IT Tom) keep a track of all the useful tools, tricks, scripts or whatever that have saved my bacon.

If this blog helps someone else then that's just a bonus ;)

Please note that I do not take any responsibilty or liability for any damage/issues that occur from following this "documentation" - as a general rule of thumb, you should always have a test environment where you can "test" this stuff before it breaks a production environment!

I am unable to give technical support for this content as my knowledge is literally what is on this blog (which isn't much).
