## Things that I've found that have saved my bacon on numerous occasions

### Big lists of goodies:

- https://getawesomeness.herokuapp.com/ - a bunch of free tools sourced from GitHub

- https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev - huge collection of free stuff for developers

### Personal recommendations:

- https://one.comodo.com/ - free managed antivirus, service desk, endpoint control/monitoring with remote control software and patch management (highly recommended for sites that have little to no IT budget!)

- https://formaholic.com/ - form storage and redirection (really useful for static websites)

- https://www.netlify.com/ - free static website hosting that uses GitHub as your storage (it powers this website as well as others I have created)
